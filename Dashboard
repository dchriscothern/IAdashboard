    "Exceptional skill at timing attacks and reactions to opponent movements. This is a big advantage when
attacking, attempting a throw, or reacting to takedowns and attacks at different speeds. Should be a grappler who seems to
always time attacks, sprawls, and defensive positioning well, especially in situations when expecting one speed and getting a
different one.",
    "Exceptional skill at locking in attention and blocking out distractions, so athlete should show
tremendous focus in the face of in-match distractions and be effective at shielding attention from distracting thoughts during
competition; should play with natural steely focus.",
    "Intermediate level skill at controlling impulses, so should generally compete with good decision patience
but expect occasional inconsistency with impulsive mental mistakes and biting on deceptive actions against top level opponents",
    "Exceptional skill at executing rapid counter-reactions. You should have a big advantage improvising reactions
in the moment and be a natural play-maker when situations suddenly break down or unexpectedly change and require a
split-second counter action.",
    "Exceptional at recognizing subtle patterns, so expect him to pick up on 
    offensive tendencies and cues instinctively as the game unfolds, and to
    naturally adapt his play on the fly",
    "Exceptionally skilled at handling complex decision rules and rapidly selecting the best action from
multiple options. Should be more than capable of handling higher numbers of decision options at real-time match speed. This is a
big advantage against more dynamic opponents who mix things up a lot",
    "Intermediate skill at learning new movement sequences and patterns, so 
    should generally incorporate and learn new mechanical skills well but expect 
    occasional difficulties or delays when attempting to learn multiple mechanical 
    or movement techniques at the same time or when attempting to learn more advanced 
    or complex movement patterns."
